[x] Conditional Compilation

Conditional compilation is a compilation technique that allows you to selectively compile code based on certain conditions. It is used in computer programming to create an executable program that can be altered by changing specified parameters

        
        ```csharp
            asd
        ```

[x] Preprocessing Directive
        Preprocessing directives are lines included in the code of programs preceded by a hash sign (#). These lines are not program statements but directives for the preprocessor. The preprocessor examines the code before actual compilation of code begins and resolves all these directives before any code is actually generated by regular statements
