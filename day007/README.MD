- [x] delegate

    delegate is a type that represents a reference to a method with a specific signature, allowing methods to be treated as first-class objects. Delegates enable the creation of callback mechanisms, event handling, and dynamic method invocation, making them essential for implementing features like event-driven programming and asynchronous operations. Delegates provide a level of abstraction that promotes decoupling of components and facilitates flexible and extensible code designs by allowing methods to be passed as arguments, stored in variables, and invoked dynamically.
